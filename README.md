# Quadratic Equation Solver

This project is a C program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. It can handle cases where the equation has real and distinct roots, a single real root, or no real roots.

## Features

- Takes coefficients of a quadratic equation as input.
- Calculates the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots.
- Computes the real roots if they exist.
- Displays the results in a user-friendly format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (like GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Quadratic-Equation-Solver.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Quadratic-Equation-Solver
    ```

3. Compile the program:
    ```sh
    gcc -o quadratic_solver main.c -lm
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```sh
    ./quadratic_solver
    ```

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation (a, b, and c). The program will then compute the roots and display the results.

Example:
```
This formula calculates the quadratic equation of the form [ax^2 + bx + c].
Please specify the coefficients.

Enter the coefficient of x^2 (a): 1
Enter the coefficient of x (b): -3
Enter the constant term (c): 2

The equation has distinct roots.
X is equal to 2.000000 or 1.000000
```
